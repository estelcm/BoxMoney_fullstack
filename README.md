It is a first raw version of a personal money manager, a mix with a moneybox  and an accounting book.
- Ideas for further development: 
    - Create a unique table for savings, and be able to relate it to objectives with the intention to be able to save money for specific objectives.
    - Eliminate erroneous movements, with a negative or positive movement as appropriate. 
    - Proper reponsive version and different views with menu and it's deployment.
